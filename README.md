# SOMB ‚Äî Snapshot of My Brain

[!["Buy Me A Coffee"](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/vmartens)

A fully open with-infrastructure newsletter & blog engine built for clarity, rapid iteration, and SaaS-readiness. Content lives in Markdown, is published as a Nue SPA static site, and is also sent to subscribers via AWS SES.

- üöÄ Easily forkable, open codebase (one repo)
- ‚òÅÔ∏è  AWS-native infra (CDK/TypeScript), GitHub Actions/CICD
- ‚úâÔ∏è  Write in Markdown; email + blog from the same file
- ü§ù Roadmap includes multi-user/SaaS, but MVP is solo-tenant

**I build this in public and blog about every design choice.**
