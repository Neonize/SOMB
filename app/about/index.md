## About

This website is my personal blog and at the same time dogfooding of [SOMB](https://github.com/Neonize/SOMB) to showcase my opensource project to build a blog and newsletter system in the open.

You can find the most information in the Github Repo but for a small overview:

- Static website builder based on Markdown with the help of [Nue](https://nuejs.org/)
- Usage of AWS as the main Cloudprovider
- Write new blog posts in Markdown, save to git and then automatically send out newsletter with the content
